# Species

## The Delvers
A species of short, hunched humanoids primarily inhabiting the undergrounds of Crannack. They specialize in ice-core mining on the cold side and primarily control that side due to their being more sensitive to light. They speak Delvish. SPACE DWARVES

## The Outsiders
Foreign species of spider-like aliens arriving in system sometime in the recent past. They arrived on a generation ship and stopped in-system to harvest minerals in order to build more generation ships to send to other systems.Mostly traders and miners, they are also known for their fierce fighting skills and are often hired by the other species as mercenaries. They requires special suits to survive on large planets of one g-force or more due to their usually surviving in low-g habitats. Their motives are relatively unknown, and they mostly stick to themselves.

## Predecessors
The ancient society that organized the solar system of the cannon verse. Not much is known about them, other than the fact that their technology is significantly more advanced and yet much older than current Tech. Their designs, weapons, and presence in the mythology and theology of the Solar System's inhabitants are extensively documented. At an indeterminate point in the past the Predecessors left the solar system. A prominent theory post-Awakening is that the Predecessors all “ascended” in the Blaze of Glory. Their language, now largely extinct save in a few old texts, was Predish.

## Humans
One of the species on Crannack. They are divided into those in the Rim (who speak Hemal) and those living in the Hotside of the planet (who speak Shular).

## Oracles
This mysterious species inhabits a planet outside the solar system, one that is lit only by high frequency light. They do not see well in the lower frequencies visible to the in-system species. The Oracles have a special connection to the other reality, and consequently can foretell future events and have a number of other psychic abilities that makes them sought after by the species of Crannack for advice and fortune telling. The only way to get to their planet is through the Shortgate, a stargate-like portal found in Crannack’s cold side that leads only to their planet. This portal is tightly controlled by the Seers, a hyper-religious organization monopolizing contact with the Oracles. Consequently, few save the Seers have seen the Oracles, and since any knowledge concerning the Oracles is kept secret and considered sacred by the Seers, little else is known about their society or their motives. The most ancient of godly tales, if interpreted correctly, teach that the Oracles had warned the Predecessors of advancing too far in their quest for greater knowledge and technology. The Oracles speak High Syrioc, a language considered holy to the Seers.
